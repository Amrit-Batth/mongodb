tell me about mongo db
ChatGPT said:
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), it doesn't use tables and rows but instead works with documents and collections.

üîπ Key Features of MongoDB:
Document-Oriented ‚Äì Stores data as BSON documents, making it easy to work with JSON.
Schema-less ‚Äì No fixed schema, allowing flexibility in data structure.
Scalability ‚Äì Supports horizontal scaling with sharding.
High Performance ‚Äì Optimized for high read and write speeds.
Indexing ‚Äì Uses indexes to speed up queries.
Replication ‚Äì Provides high availability through replica sets.
üîπ Basic MongoDB Concepts:
Database ‚Äì A container for collections.
Collection ‚Äì A group of related documents (like a table in SQL).
Document ‚Äì A single record stored in BSON format (similar to a JSON object).
Field ‚Äì A key-value pair in a document.
Primary Key ‚Äì _id is automatically assigned as a unique identifier for each document.
üîπ Example of a MongoDB Document:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": "123456",
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "MongoDB"],
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  }
}
üîπ Common MongoDB Commands:
Show databases ‚Üí show dbs
Use a database ‚Üí use myDatabase
Show collections ‚Üí show collections
Insert a document ‚Üí
js
Copy
Edit
db.users.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 30 });
Find documents ‚Üí db.users.find({ age: 30 })
Update a document ‚Üí
js
Copy
Edit
db.users.updateOne({ name: "John" }, { $set: { age: 31 } });
Delete a document ‚Üí db.users.deleteOne({ name: "John" })

ChatGPT said:
If you want to add data in JSON format to MongoDB, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Insert JSON Data Using MongoDB Compass (Graphical Interface)
If you are using MongoDB Compass, follow these steps:

Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your database.
Select your database ‚Üí Click on a collection (or create one).
Click "Insert Document".
Paste your JSON data and modify it as needed.
json
Copy
Edit
{
   "_id": {
      "$oid": "67ce87255b45fabd189276a0"
   },
   "name": "John Doe",
   "age": 30,
   "city": "New York"
}
Click "Insert" to save the document.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Insert JSON Data Using MongoDB Shell (mongosh)
If you're using the MongoDB shell (mongosh), use the insertOne or insertMany command:

Insert One Document:
js
Copy
Edit
use myDatabase;  // Switch to your database
db.myCollection.insertOne({
   "_id": ObjectId("67ce87255b45fabd189276a0"),
   "name": "John Doe",
   "age": 30,
   "city": "New York"
});
Insert Multiple Documents:
js
Copy
Edit
db.myCollection.insertMany([
   {
      "_id": ObjectId("67ce87255b45fabd189276a1"),
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 25,
      "city": "Los Angeles"
   },
   {
      "_id": ObjectId("67ce87255b45fabd189276a2"),
      "name": "Bob",
      "age": 28,
      "city": "Chicago"
   }
]);
‚úÖ Note: If you don‚Äôt specify _id, MongoDB will automatically generate a unique ObjectId.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Insert JSON Data Using a .json File (Mongo Import)
If you have multiple JSON documents in a file (data.json), you can insert them using mongoimport:

Create a data.json file and add your JSON data:
json
Copy
Edit
[
   {
      "_id": { "$oid": "67ce87255b45fabd189276a0" },
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30,
      "city": "New York"
   },
   {
      "_id": { "$oid": "67ce87255b45fabd189276a1" },
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 25,
      "city": "Los Angeles"
   }
]
Run the following command in Command Prompt (CMD):
sh
Copy
Edit
mongoimport --uri="mongodb://localhost:27017" --db=myDatabase --collection=myCollection --file=data.json --jsonArray
Which Method Do You Want to Use?
MongoDB Compass (GUI) ‚Üí Easiest for beginners
MongoDB Shell (mongosh) ‚Üí For manual insertion
Mongo Import (mongoimport) ‚Üí Best for bulk inserts
